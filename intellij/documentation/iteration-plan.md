## Iteration Plan #2 Planning 

RANKING USE CASES 

Example:


Rank (priority)
  * Use Case 
    * Comments on criticality, risk, coverage 


High Rank 
* __Reporting Busyness__
    * the main function of the app 
    * have to already have a location in order for it to work 
    * most important action for the user to take --> most likely to crash

Middle Rank 
* __Checking Busyness__
  * the most used component of the app (can view rating without having to rate)

Low Rank
* __Adding Location__
  * have to make sure it does not overwrite other locations 
* __Manage Location__ 
  * for administrators only 
* __Change Time Period__
  * special feature to aggregate crowd reports

## Iteration #3 plan 

For the second phase of elaboration, we would like to add the functionality to add a location and to add ratings for a location. This will also involve averaging all existing ratings for a location into the overall crowd rating field for each location. 

## Iteration #4 plan 
For the next phase of elaboration, we would like to add more design elements (fonts, colors, maybe graphics). 
Furthermore, we would like to incorporate an administrator's view of the app which allows you to delete locations and comments.
