## Iteration Plan #2 Planning 

RANKING USE CASES 

Example:


Rank (priority)
  * Use Case 
    * Comments on criticality, risk, coverage 


High Rank 
* __Rating Location__
    * the main function of the app 
    * have to already have a location in order for it to work 
    * most important action for the user to take --> most likely to crash

Middle Rank 
* __Viewing Location__
  * the most used component of the app (can view rating without having to rate)

Low Rank
* __Adding New Location__
  * have to make sure it does not overwrite other locations
