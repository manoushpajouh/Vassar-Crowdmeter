## Name of Application 
Vassar CrowdMeter 

## Descriptions

This application is meant for users (particularly students at Vassar College) to be able to view specific locations on the campus in terms of how busy they are at a particular moment at their convenience. Users are able to submit ratings for any chosen location (or create their own location if it does not previously exist) in order to keep the busyness ratings as updated as possible. These ratings go from a 1-5 scale (in terms of density: 1 being pretty empty, 5 being super full). Furthermore, users can choose to leave comments with their ratings (which administrators can then filter through in order to prevent spam) 

Features in the application include:
* Search tab to find a specific location
* Table of specific locations on campus that are available to be rated
* Rating scale to input and update the busyness of an area
* Coordinating color palette to ratings of busyness


## Visuals
For the final implementation of this application, the app will display a heatmap of Vassar's campus which is color-coordinated and updated regularly in order to accurately reflect the busyness ratings of each location. Users have the ability to pinch to zoom in and out of the map. Users are allowed to click on each location in order to check comments or add their own rating.
The app will also contain a search bar to search a particular location without having to find the location on the heat map.

As of now, the app will be limited as to display a list of all of the already existing locations within the program for the user to click on to add/view a comment or to add a rating. There will be a search bar in order to filter through locations efficiently and to see if the location already exists in order to prevent making a duplicate location.

## Installation
This application runs only for Android, thus must first be downloaded/installed in the Android app store.

How to run the prototype - i.e., identifying the class containing the main() method, and any relevant command line arguments or usage instructions.

In order to run the prototype, one must run the UI class (UI.java file) and from there, instructions on how to proceed will appear. Follow the instructions by typing in examples (for example: when asked for a location, enter "deece") and the prototype will continue to the next step, allowing the user to proceed to the following instruction (whether that be to view a rating or add a location)


## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
